# Simple 2d Canvas boilerplate üñº

#### _Simple template to get started with 2D canvas on your own!_

Don't know where to start making games/ simulation on JS?
Just use this template as the starting point.
Just enough to get started.

Start simply by cloning the repo:

```sh
git clone <github-repo>
```

Now go to the directroy and setup the application by using `yarn` or `npm`
(make sure you node js, npm or yarn on your machine)
if you have, run this on your terminal

```sh
yarn
```

Once everything is setup, you can start the application by:

```sh
yarn dev
```

The template includes:

- Simple HTML file with canvas.
- Canvas looping engine with Controlled FPS.
- Dummy box which moves around.
- Small vector file to take advantage from.

### Noice! You are all set.

### Happy Hacking üç∫
